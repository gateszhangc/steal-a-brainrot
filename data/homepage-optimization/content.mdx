<h2 id="what-is">What is Steal A Brainrot?</h2>
<p><strong>Steal a Brainrot</strong> is a fun, <strong>chaotic 3D Roblox casual heist game</strong> that features many Italian Brainrot meme characters, each one generating income at their own rate. In this game, your main goal is to fill your base with Brainrots to grow your passive income as fast as possible. You start with an empty base and can either build it steadily by buying Brainrots from your conveyor or take a riskier path by stealing them from other players or combining both.</p>
<p>The game features dozens of Brainrot characters, divided into <strong>7 tiers</strong> or rarities. Every Brainrot character generates income at a unique rate—higher-tier ones consistently bring in more.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-play">How to Play and Collect Rewards in Steal A Brainrot</h2>
<p>You start with some in-game money and an empty base. To generate more, it's a must to buy Brainrots, which automatically yield a certain amount per second. Basically, you begin with basic ones first, then purchase higher-tier ones when you can afford them.</p>
<h3 id="buy-first">Buy your first Brairots: Noobini Pizzanini</h3>
<p>Noobini Pizzanini costs just a quarter of your initial budget; it's your best option at the beginning when you have just a limited budget. Head to the spawn zone (a conveyor belt) to pick them. In Steal A Brainrot, you can buy a Brainrot multiple times, as long as you can afford it.</p>
<h3 id="get-funds">Get in-game funds &amp; buy higher-tier Brainrots</h3>
<p>Brainrots start generating resources as soon as they're placed in your base. Collect your income; once you have enough, go back to the conveyor belt to grab a more expensive Brainrot, which is sure to come with a higher generation rate and bring you more collections. Here's the core, simple loop: collect income and invest in higher-tier Brainrots to maximize your collectings.</p>
<p><strong>Tip: Be sure that you have enough space for new Brainrots. If it's full, sell the Brainrots with the lowest income rate.</strong></p>
<h3 id="steal">Steal the Brainrot from others (if possible)</h3>
<p>Spot a nearby player with your dream Brainrots? Sneak into their base, grab those characters, and bring them to your base. This is faster but dangerous, since you risk being counterattacked. Do not forget that your base can be raided as well, so be sure to defend it well to keep thieves out.</p>

<h2 id="tips">Bonus: 5 Pro Tips and Tricks to Progress Faster</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Kick things off early with low-rate Brainrots. Don't underestimate their powers; they give you essential boosts when you have just a little money in hand.</li>
  <li>Keep at least one slot free when you want a new Brainrot. You can't collect new Brainrots if your base is full. So, sell one first before getting another.</li>
  <li>Keep an eye on the conveyor belt for legendary and mythic Brainrots. They guarantee incredible income rates but don't show up often. Prioritize grabbing them to boost your collectings.</li>
  <li>Steal smart. If you'd like to steal others' Brainrot, target weaker bases without much defense to maximize gains with less risk.</li>
  <li>Balance offense and defense. Don't leave your base open while chasing raids. It's obvious, right?</li>
